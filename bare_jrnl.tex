\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
%\graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
\graphicspath{{images/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
% or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
% will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
% driver is specified.
% \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo s use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

	\begin{abstract}
		Recently machine learning methods had gain lots of publicity among researchers in order to analyze the brain images such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(fMRI) to obtain better understanding of the brain and brain related disease such as Alzheimer's disease. Classification methods has been deployed in order to discriminate Alzheimer's disease from normal controls. The majority of deployed techniques rely on constructing the functional connectivity (FC) and use the vectorized FC as the input for the classifiers which has two main drawbacks 1) The need for constructing the FC 2) The loss of possible valuable structural information in the vectorization step.
		Considering these problems and based on the 4D nature of the data, we have came up with a novel framework which omits the FC construction part and preserve the structural integrity of data for the classification.
		The proposed framework uses the High Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) in order to prune the classes and select the proper basis for each of them. This framework also allows us to obtain an FC matrix based on a class but not a single sample which helps us to shed more lights on the brain abnormalities in the Alzheimers disease at its early stages. 
		Extensive experiments using the ADNI dataset demonstrate that
		our proposed framework effectively boosts the fMRI classification performance and reveals novel connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease at its early stages.

	\IEEEPARstart{A}{lzheimer’s} disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a long pre-morbid asymptomatic period which affects millions of elderly individuals worldwide\cite{r01}. It is predicted that the number of affected people will double in the next 20 years, and 1 in 85 people will be affected by 2050 \cite{r02}. The predominant clinical symptoms of AD include a decline in some important brain cognitive and intellectual abilities, such as memory, thinking, and reasoning. Precise diagnosis of AD, especially at its early warning stage: early Mild Cognitive Impairment (eMCI), enables treatments to delay or even avoid such disorders \cite{r03}.  
	
	
	In recent years, brain imaging techniques like Positron Emission Tomography(PET)\cite{r21}, Electroencephalography (EEG)\cite{r22}
	 and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)\cite{r23} 
	 have been used in analysis of AD. Due to the high spatial resolution and relatively lower costs, fMRI is vastly used among researchers in order to monitor brain activities especially in AD and all its stages in which detecting abnormalities within small brain regions is essential \cite{r04}. 
	An fMRI sample is naturally a 4D tensor consisting of 3D voxels moving in time, and each voxel contains an intensity value that is proportional to the strength of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent(BOLD) signal, which is a measure of the changes in blood flow, to estimate the activity of different brain regions\cite{r07}.
	Resting-state fMRI(rs-fMRI) is an fMRI technique in which the patient is asked to rest during the whole scan, focuses on the low-frequency $\left( < 0.1 Hz \right)$  oscillations of BOLD signal, which presents the underlying neuronal activation patterns of brain regions[8]–[10]. rs-fMRI is usually used in order to analyze brain diseases like AD or autism\cite{r33,r34}.
	%
	%Since the number of voxels within a single full scan is high 
	%($5000$ up to roughly $200,000$[ref(Definingnodes)]) and they form strong spatial relations, 
	
	Since each fMRI volume consist of hundreds of thousands of voxels which are often highly correlated with the surrounding voxels in the brain volume, parcellation of the brain for further analysis has moved toward the use
	of anatomical atlases. These atlases are strictly defined using
	anatomical features of the brain, like locations of common gyri
	and do not rely on any functional information.
	To generate data
	using an Atlas based approach, the BOLD signal from all voxels is averaged within each brain region called Region of Interest(ROI)\cite{r09}.
	By putting together the average time-series for all the ROIs, the $i$th volume would become $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times R} , i = \{1,2,\cdots, S\}$ in which $R$, $T$ and $S$ are the number of ROIs, time points and samples respectively. %The process of obtaining such a matrix is shown in Figure \ref{g1.1}.% 
%		\begin{figure*}[!t]
%		\centering
%		\includegraphics[width=6in]{Data}
%		\caption{The process of extracting ROI time-series from the original 4D volume. }
%		\label{g1.1}
%	\end{figure*}
	
	There are two major studies associated with rs-fMRI data: finding common brain disorders caused by diseases like Alzheimer's or autism, and more recently detecting patients with brain disorders using classification techniques \cite{r35,r36}. Due to the high dimensionality of data and the nature of diseases like eMCI which does not show any reliable clinical symptoms,
	researchers moved towards advanced machine learning techniques in order to achieve more reliable analysis \cite{r37}.
	
	
	%Two major studies could carry out using these  $X_i$s: 
	%\begin{itemize}
	%	\item Identifying patients with brain disorders: Because of the nature of the data, advance machine learning techniques should be deployed inorder to detect any abnormalities within an individual scan. 
	%	In recent years, classification techniques has been deployed  to classify the $X_i$s. These studies holds great promise for eMCI detection.     
	%	\item Extracting common patterns caused by a disease: An other useful information that could be extracted from such data, is the detection of common patterns emerging from a certain brain disorder such as eMCI. For example, compared with the healthy,  MCI patients have been observed both increased and decreased activities within  different brain regions [4].
	%\end{itemize}
	
	A powerful tool that is commonly used in order to achieve aforementioned goals is Functional Connectivity(FC) network.  FC is a $region \times region$ matrix $\bar{X}$ in which $\bar{x}_{ij}$ represents the functional connectivity between the $i$th and $j$th ROI. Functional connectivity is an observable
	phenomenon quantifiable with measures of statistical dependencies, such as correlations, coherence, or transfer entropy \cite{r38}.  Recent studies have shown that some brain disorders like AD could alter the way that some brain regions interact with each other. For example, compared with the healthy, AD patients have been found decreased functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions, and MCI patients have been observed increased functional connectivity between the frontal lobe and other brain regions[4]. 
	Although FCs show promising results, they bring their own challenges. 
	Variety of methods exists in order to calculate the FC which cause in vastly different results. 
	
	
	%There are two major issues associated with FC networks:
	%\begin{itemize}
	%	\item There are variety of methods for obtaining the FC matrix which heavily affect the quality of the network. Pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficient \cite{r10, r11}, sparse representation \cite{r10, r12, r13}  and Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation (SICE) are of the popular ones \cite{r14, r15}. While the first two are easy to understand and can capture pairwise functional relationship based on a pair of ROIs, the latter can account for more complex interactions among multiple ROIs, but the estimation of partial correlation involves an inversion of a covariance matrix, which may be ill-posed due to the singularity of the covariance matrix. 
	%	
	%	\item On the other hand, computing the correlation based on the entire time series of fMRI data simply measures the FC between ROIs with a scalar value, which is fixed across time. This actually implicitly hypothesizes the stationary interaction patterns among ROIs. As a result, this method may overlook the complex and dynamic interaction patterns among ROIs, which are essentially time-varying \cite{r16}\textendash \cite{r19}.
	%	
	%\end{itemize}
	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
%	Finding an FC that highlights the patterns caused by a disease has been a common goal in the rs-fMRI study for a long time. Several approaches exist to find common patterns among different brain scans. Data-driven methods such as kernel-PCA or clustering techniques have been proposed for this task\textcolor{red}{ref?}. But ultimately most of them rely on calculating a network for each volume. This may overlook the role of noises or outliers within the data. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	%As we will show later, our proposed method does not rely on any individual FC calculations and treats each class as a whole in order to calculate the FC.

	In this paper, based on high order tensor decomposition, we have created a framework in which the mentioned goals i.e. finding an FC for a whole class and detecting a disorder via classification could be achieved with a single High Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) of each class.
	Here based on latent variables obtained by HOSVD a general representative pattern of FC for eMCI and Normal subjects is obtained.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
%	Experiments show that the discovered functional connectivities by the proposed method are confirmed by empirical methods. Also, The proposed classifier outperforms state of the art eMCI classification methods.

	Viewing each class as a tensor allows us to work with \textit{time} and \textit{region} features separately but simultaneously. This multilinear view
	ables us to design a proper dimension reduction relative to the nature of each feature along with a discriminant function based on linear regression \textcolor{red}{on latent space of samples} that uses the test data to enhance the quality of the training set without forcing any a prior knowledge to the classifier, a task which is not possible through well known classifiers like SVM, logistic regression or k-NN. It is also notable that the proposed discriminant function directly works with the $X_i$s as features. Having the FC calculation step omitted not only heavily affects the computational performance of the method,  it also saves us from the troubles of FCs mentioned before.        
	
	
	%	in this paper we show that tensor representation is the natural form to present fMRI images. by this representation, we would be able to work with time and region features seperately in the same time. also with this representation we an easy and affordable multilinear dimension reduction that works with time and region features seperately this will be done by high order singular value decomposition of of the normal and eMCI subjects.
	
	%	also we show that by this representation and using the obtained HOSVD, dimension reduction step we can obtain tensor based discriminat features for classification. this discriminant method furthermore simplicity is very effective. here we show that by this framework the test data also could have effect in construction of discriminant function which is impossible in well known classification methods like SVM, logistic regression and etc. 
	
	%	by this approach the construction of FC feature that was time consuming is ignored and we represent an other method that at the same time with simple structure and low computation cost gives very high quality results with the other state of the art methods. 
	
	%	in fMRI data, one other feature is the fnctional connectivity of normal and abnormal subjects. as the third innovation of this paper we showed that based on hosvd of normal and eMCI patients and effective and high quality functional connectivity network can be extracted for both classes. we will show that some connectivities that are discovered via these FCs are well studied in recent clinical documents and thus . . .

	%	Distinguishing two rs-fMRI volumes in the machine learning viewpoint can be considered as a two class classification problem.
	%	%
	%	%in the first view, usualy and fMRI image in learning is considered as a time x region matrix $X_i \in T \times R$.
	%	Some methods use the vectorized version of samples ie, $x_i = vec(X_i)\in \mathbb{R}^T$ as  inputs of the learning process. However as we will discuss later, this vectorization may cause the loss of some important properties within the structure of data, and because of that the dominant approaches tend to find different set of features for each sample. These methods  construct a $region \times region$ matrix $\bar{X}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{R \times R}$ which is often called functional connectivity (FC) matrix and indicates the between correlation of ROIs. Since in most fMRI samples the number of timepoints is larger that the number of ROIs i.e.  $ T  > R$, substituting $X_i$ with $\bar{X}_i$ reduce the number of features and the effects of the \textit{curse of dimensionality}, also 
	%	it has been shown that using FC can enhance small between region connections hence turns FC into a powerful tool for rs-fMRI data analysis. For correlation computation, different methods have been explored, among which the pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficient \cite{r10, r11}, sparse representation \cite{r10, r12, r13}  and Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation (SICE) are of the popular ones \cite{r14, r15}. While the first two are easy to understand and can capture pairwise functional relationship based on a pair of ROIs, the latter can account for more complex interactions among multiple ROIs, but the estimation of partial correlation involves an inversion of a covariance matrix, which may be ill-posed due to the singularity of the covariance matrix. On the other hand, computing the correlation based on the entire time series of RS-fMRI data simply measures the FC between ROIs with a scalar value, which is fixed across time. This actually implicitly hypothesizes the stationary interaction patterns among ROIs. As a result, this method may overlook the complex and dynamic interaction patterns among ROIs, which are essentially time-varying \cite{r16}\textendash \cite{r19}.
	%	In order to overcome this issue, some methods have been proposed that consider the time as a non-stationery property. As for an example [] uses sliding-window technique in order to divide the time series into several smaller parts and then calculate the between correlation of these parts.[][] although these methods show promissing classification results, they are not computational favorable and since the aspect of region is not preserved in the final model, the relation between the high-order FC and the real world FC is somewhat ambigues. After calculating the FC, conventional classifiers like SVM or KNN is deployed in order to classify the vectorized FC for each sample \cite{r20}. 
	
	%	Although FC grants us certain useful structural properties such as being SPD and having relatively low dimensionality, using  it in the classification process has its own drawbacks such as calculating the proper FC and extracting key features from it. Considering these issues we have come up with a framework that eliminate the need for finding the FC in the classification process. Also the proposed framework works directly with the sample matrix and preserve its structural integrity by avoiding the vectorization using novel multilinear techniques.    
	%	(more about vectorization?)
	
	%	In this paper we claim that by considering $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^ {T \times R}$ as the sample, the dataset could be considered as an order three tensor. Using this representation we have shown that by extremely lower computational cost compared with other methods, and without the need to construct FC, a framework can be designed that only by one High Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) for each class could give us the desired results. This framework which we call it \textbf{TBNA} (High Order Feature Selection and Extraction) does three main tasks: 
	%	\begin{itemize}
	%		\item
	%		\textbf{Dimension Reduction:}
	%		The proposed frameworks allows us to select key features of each mode  (i.e. \textit{Time}, \textit{Region} and \textit{sample}) of the constructed tensor seperately and differently. This feature extraction would cause a massive reduction of the dimensions.
	%		
	%		\item
	%		\textbf{Classification:} 
	%		Based on the properties of the HOSVD, we have eliminated the vectorization at any step and hence assure that no information is lost in the vectorization process. Moreover we have formed a novel  classification enhancement technique that allows the test samples to cooperate in the training phase. This technique increases the tendency of the test sample to it's true class without forcing any apriory knowledge about it's label to the trainer. 
	%		
	%		\item
	%		\textbf{Functional Connectivity Network Construction:}
	%		Being able to see the class as a whole ables us to derive a Functional Connectivity network for each class. Such FCs allows us to investigate on shared properties within each class such as functional abnormalities of some ROIs or the connection between them.

	%	%The novelty of this paper can be categorized in two cases:  The dimension reduction of fMRI samples, and the enhanced classifier.

	To verify our approach, we conduct an extensive experimental study on rs-fMRI data from the
	benchmark dataset ADNI
	%\footnote{http://adni.loni.usc.edu/} 
	As will be seen, the results well demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method. Specifically, the proposed framework, not only grants us superior classification accuracy to that from other methods, it is also much faster and more stable against different data selection schemes. We have also confirmed our achieved whole-class FC matrix using empirical data on the eMCI and Normal functional connectivity patterns.

	\section{eMCI classification techniques}
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	
%	As it was discussed before, classification techniques have become a favorable method for Alzheimer disease early detection. early classification methods used $X_{i}$s as the representative for each subject and used them directly in the classification process\textcolor{red}{ref?}. 
%	As the functional connectivity matrix gain popularity among researchers, the majority of these classification methods shifted towards classifying the functional connectivity matrices\textcolor{red}{add some references!!}. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	As it was mentioned before, obtaining and classifying FC matrices have become the dominant approach towards eMCI classification. 
	Variety of methods such as Pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficient \cite{r10, r11}, sparse representation \cite{r10, r12, r13}  and Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation (SICE)\cite{r15} exists to obtain an FC,
	While the first two are easy to understand and can capture pairwise functional relationship based on a pair of ROIs, the latter can account for more complex interactions among multiple ROIs, but the estimation of partial correlation involves an inversion of a covariance matrix, which may be ill-posed due to the singularity of the covariance matrix. 
	These methods result in vastly different networks\cite{r35}. On the other hand, computing the correlations, based on the entire time series of fMRI data simply measures the FC between ROIs with a scalar value, which is fixed across time. This actually implicitly hypothesizes the \textbf{Stationary} interaction patterns among ROIs. As a result, this method may overlook the complex and dynamic interaction patterns among ROIs, which are essentially time-varying. In order to overcome this issue, \textbf{Non-stationary} methods have been proposed which results in more complex networks\cite{r16}\textendash \cite{r19}.
		
%	There are two main paradigms towards obtaining the FCs: Stationary and non-stationary methods. Stationary methods use a single scaler value like Partial correlation or \textcolor{red}{sparse coefficients} in order to determine the functional connectivity between two ROIs. Non-stationary methods consider a more complex relation between ROIs that can not be best captured with a single scaler value. 
	
	In the following we briefely discuss two state of the art eMCI classification techniques belonging to these two paradigms:
	
%	In the following for future comparisons with our method, we explain  the mentioned state of the art  candidates from  these two approaches in details. As one of the main methods in this approch we can mentioed a method proposed in??. This method
%	uses the Sparse Inverse Covariance matrix in order to establish a functional connectivity matrix and then using the SPD property of SICE, propose a dimension reduction technique in order to find a set of low dimensional features for classification. The reported results in ?? demonstrate the quality of this method over other ones.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%	\textcolor{red}{In this approach different kinds of methods has been used to obtain Fc matrix, like methods based on Pearson's correlation, sparse coding and SICE. Ref????. In classification steps the vectorization of these FC matrices are used.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		
	
	
		
	
	%In order to demonstrate the power of our proposed framework, we have implemented an state of the art method from each of these paradigms.
	
	
	% The first method which is an stationary one The second method which is non-stationary,     
	
	
	
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mathbf{Kernel Compact SICE(K-SIEC):}$ 
	\end{itemize}
	This method which belongs to the stationary paradigm was proposed in \cite{r14}. In this method, the SICE matrix is chosen as the FC for each sample, then using the SPD property of this matrix, kernel-PCA is deployed in order to reduce its dimensions.

	The SICE matrix is extracted from the data sample $S$ using the following optimization: 
	\begin{align}
	S^* = \operatorname{arg} \max\limits_{S\succ 0} \hspace{3mm} \log \left( \det(S) \right) - \operatorname{tr}(CS) - \lambda \norm{S}_1
	\end{align}
	where $C$ is the sample-based covariance matrix; $\det(·)$, $\operatorname{tr}(·)$,
	and $\norm{.}_1$ denote the determinant, trace, and the sum of the absolute values of the entries of a matrix. 
	%\textcolor{red}{Since the  SICE matrix is in $\mathbb{R}^{R\times R}$}, with $R$ representing the number of ROIs, the obtained matrix is still relatively large. 
%	Principal Component Analysis(PCA) has proved itself to be one of the most powerful methods of dimension reduction and this method uses Kernel-PCA with a Gaussian kernel in order to extract the key features of SICE.
In order to reduce the dimensionality of the obtained SICE matrix, Kernel-PCA with a Gaussian kernel is used  to extract the key features.
	\textcolor{red}{Since SICE is an SPD matrix, specific distance functions such as Log-Euclidean distance\cite{r49} or Root Stein divergence\cite{r50} can be used as the distance function in the Gaussian kernel. Analogous to linear PCA, and by defining 
	$\Phi(\cdot) = Sym^{+}_{d} \mapsto \mathcal{F}$ as the kernel map, 
	 for a given SICE matrix $S$,$\Phi(S)$ can then be projected onto the top $m$ eigenvectors to obtain an $m$-dimensional principal
	component vector. These vectors are used to train an SVM classifier. The performance of this method heavily relies on the choice of sparsity parameter $\lambda$ and the number of top eigenvectors $m$. }   
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mathbf{High Order Networks(HON):}$
	\end{itemize}
 This method which belongs to non-stationary paradigm uses so called
	 High Order Networks as features for classification purposes. It uses the sliding window technique  in order to split the time-series into smaller pieces and then find the relation between them\cite{r51}\textendash \cite{r52}. Let $x_{i}^{(l)}(k) \in \mathbb{R}^N$ denote the $k$-th segment of subseries extracted from $x_{i}^{(l)}$, which comprises $N$ image volumes. by taking each $x_{i}^{(l)}(k)$ as a node, A network can be constructed with edges defined using:
	\[
	C_{ij}^{(l)}(k) = \operatorname{corr}\left(x_{i}^{(l)}(k),x_{j}^{(l)}(k)
	\right)
	\]
	which represents the pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficients
	between the $i$-th and the $j$-th ROIs of the $l$-th subject using the $k$-th segment of subseries. 
	%\[
	%G_l^{(l)}(k) = \left( 
	%\{ x_i^{(l)}(k) \} , \{ C_{ij}^{(l)}(k) \}
	%\right)
	%\]
	by taking  
	\[
	y_{ij}^{(l)} = \left[ 
	C_{ij}^{(l)}(1), C_{ij}^{(l)}(2), \cdots , C_{ij}^{(K)}(1) 
	\right] \in \mathbb{R}^K
	\]
	as new nodes, an other network can be calculated as follow: 
	\[
	H_{ij,pq}^{(l)} = \operatorname{corr} \left(
	y_{ij}^{(l)},y_{pq}^{(l)}
	\right)
	\]
	for each pair of correlation time series $y_{ij}$ and $y_{pq}$ thus, $H_{ij,pq}^{(l)}$ indicates how the correlation between the $i$-th and the $j$-th ROIs influence the correlation between the $p$-th and the $q$-th ROIs.
	The total number of the high-order correlation coefficients
	$\{ H_{ij,pq}^{(l)} \}$ is proportional to $R^4$ which will lead to a large-scale high-order FC
	network, containing at least thousands of vertices and millions
	of edges. In order to overcome this issue, the correlation time series within each subject is grouped into different clusters. Then, the correlation calculation
	between the original correlation time series can be
	converted into that between the respective mean correlation
	time series in clusters. After reducing the network size, the
	weighted-graph local clustering coefficients was used to select the key features for each network and then an SVM classifier is trained in order to classify the obtained features.  
	%	\end{itemize}
	
	It is noteworthy that non of these techniques consider the multi-linearity nature of the data, and since both methods use traditional classifiers like SVM or KNN, they follow a rather complex path to find vector features as the representative of each FC matrix.
	
	
	\section{Proposed fMRI analysis Framework Based On Tensor framework}
	% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
	%\IEEEpubidadjcol
	All main mentioned eMCI classification methods use FC of each sample as an input feature. So, the computational complexity of these methods are high due to the construction of FC matrices. In addition, the quality of the obtained FC heeavily affects the  classification performance. Moreover, none of these methods  attend  the multi-linear propriety of such data.
	In this section by tensor viewpoint we show that only by one tensor decomposition we could do the following analysis on fMRI data:

\textbullet\ $\mathbf{Classification:}$
\textcolor{red}{
	Viewing each class as a 3D tensor ables us to separately project each mode into a smaller one, without the necessity of unfolding it into matrices or vectors, and thus preserving the structural integrity of data along with reducing its dimensions. Transferring each sample matrix $X_i\in \mathbb{R}^{T \times R}$ into the new feature space granted by tensor viewpoint, obsoletes the necessity of constructing the FC for each sample by producing a high quality and low-dimensional feature $\bar{X}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{\bar{T} \times \bar{R}}$ in which $\bar{T}$ and $\bar{R}$ are drastically smaller that $T$ and $R$. This viewpoint also ables us to design a novel discriminant function in which the test data is used in the training process without forcing any apriory knowledge about its label to the classifier, a task which is impossible via the conventional classifiers such as SVM, K-NN or logistic regression.  
}


	 
%	time-region matrices  without folding and construction of FC matrix per-sample. Here data set of each class is denoted by a tensor and by using the HOSVD of such data
%	all region-time matrices are projected to smaller ones(without folding the data to vectors). Also based on this HOSVD decpmoistion  we design a tensor based discriminant function for classification.As the first time we propose a novel method that allows test data have a contribution in constructions of discriminant function of each class without using extra information. This idea have a big effect in the quality of propped method.
%	
%	Since this method directly works on region-time matrices as input features, its computational complexity is more smaller than state of the art methods that use FC matrices as input feature. Also the experimental results confirm the quality of this method in recognition of normal and eMCI data.

\textbullet\ $\mathbf{General~FC:}$
\textcolor{red}{
Using the components of HOSVD extracted in the previous step, a general FC could be constructed for each class that reveals patterns common shared among all samples within each class. This technique allows us to discard the role of outliers or noisy samples.  
}
%By this HOSVD decomposition we	
%	proposed a novel method that could 
%	find a general representative FC for eMCI and Normal data. In this method having the FC of all samples is not necessary. 
%	{\color{red} In the experiments we show that the obtained FC contains  relations that recently  
%		founded experimentally(clinically).} 
	% By using High order singular value eecomposition
	% (HOSVD), all region-time matrices are projected to
	% smaller matrices (without flding the data to vectors
	%\end{itemize}
	%}
	%By using the properties of HOSVD, the proposed framework allows us to reduce the dimensionality of data, create a discriminant function and enhance it and also calculate an FC network. These four features are discussed in full detail in the following sections:
	%%Begin Dr.Rezghi Suggestions
	\subsection{ A Classification of Region-Time data of eMCI and normal data based on  Tensor framework}
	%In region based fMRI data  each data is a region-Time matrix $X\in \mathbb{R}^{T\times R}$, where $T, R$ denote the length of time and regions of the data.
	For reducing the computational complexity and reducing the  occurrence of over fitting, specially for data with large features (Like fMRI data), using  dimensionality reduction is inevitable. Although each sample $X\in \mathbb{R}^{T\times R}$ has two different time and region features, the classical methods like PCA, SVD ,... only could work on vectorized version $x=vec(X)$ of such data.
	% In these methods by having projection matrix $U$(Due to method), the projected data will be $y=U^{\sf T}x$.
	Although this approach is easy to deploy, it has several drawbacks like occurrence of Curse of dimensionality and mixing different features(time and region).
	% would be the Curse of dimensionality that appears when the proportion of the number of features to the number of samples is relatively high (which results in over-fitting). 
	%Also in this view different kind of features(like \emph{Time} and \emph{region} in our case) would be mixed together which may discard some important information within these features. The second approach is to deploy multilinear methods. 
	%This vectorizatin forthermore inceasing the computatina coplexity, mixed the metioed two type of vectors. 
	Recently multilinear dimension reduction methods like MPCA, GLRAM  have been proposed that
	could works with multidimensional data, without folding them into vectors.
	In these methods there is a freedom to select specific reduction for each kind of feature. In this section we will used well known tensor decomposition named HOSVD for dimension reduction and also classification of fMRI data.
	
	%Let ${X_1,\ldots,X_{s_1}}$ and  ${X_1,\ldots,X_{s_2}}$ be the train data of eMCI and Normal classes, respectively.
	Let tensors $\mathcal{X}^{(i)}\in \mathbb{R}^{T\times R \times S_i}$, consists normal and eMCI data, for i=1,2, respectively.  Here $S_1,S_2$ are the number of normal and eMCI data.
	% Also
	% mode-2 slices of each tensor show  the sample data.
	%the sample data. 
	%Let $\mathcal{X}^{(i)}\in \mathbb{R}^{T \times R \times S_i}$, where each slice $X(:,:,i)$ denotes the time-region feature of the $i^{th}$ sample.
	For tensor $\mathcal{X}^{(i)}$, the decomposition
	\begin{equation}
	\label{ho}
	\mathcal{X}^{(i)} = 
	\left(  
	U^{(i)},V^{(i)},W^{(i)}
	\right)\boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{S}^{(i)},
	\end{equation}
	is known as higher order singular decomposition(HOSVD),
	where orthogonal matrices $U^{(i)}\in \mathbb{R}^{T\times T}, V^{(i)}\in \mathbb{R}^{R\times R} $ and $W^{(i)}\in \mathbb{R}^{S_i\times S_i}$ are known as modes-1,2,3 singular matrices of 
	and $\mathcal{S}^{(i)}$ is the corresponding core tensor \textcolor{red}{Ref?}. Here $U^{(i)}$ is a base of all mode-$ 1 $ fibers $\mathcal{X}(:,l,k)$. Here  $\mathcal{X}^{(i)}(:,l,k)$ indicates the behavior of $l$th region of the $k$th sample of the $i$th class in all times. Also  $V^{(i)}$ is a base of all mode-$ 2 $ fibers $\mathcal{X}(l,:,k)$ which indicates the behavior of all regions of  $l$th  sample of the $i$th class in  the $k$th time.
	Also, due to the properties of HOSVD inherited from svd, the first columns of mode-k (k=1,2,3) has more ability in construction of main parts of $k$th fibers and on the other hand, the last columns of  this singular matrix, are corresponding to noise parts of the fibers of the mode \textcolor{red}{ref??}. Therefore, with appropriate values of $k^i_1$ and $k^i_2$ projection of mode-1 and mode-2 fibers into space spanned by  the first $k_1$ and $k_2$ singular vectors of modes-1,2, which  are denoted by  $U^{(i)}_{k^i_1}$ and $V_{k^i_2}^{(i)}$, respectively,
	is a suitable  dimension reduction. This dimensionality reduction could be done as
	\begin{align}
	\label{m1}
	\mathbb{R}^{k_1 \times k_2 \times S_i} \ni  \bar{{\mathcal{X}}}^{(i)} = \left( 
	U^{(i) {\sf {T}}}_{k^i_1}, V_{k^i_2}^{\sf {T}}
	\right)_{1,2}\boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{X}^{(i)}
	\end{align}
	%So, by having mode-2 and mode-2 singular matrices of tensor $\mathcal{X}$, its reduced versin $\overline{\mathcal{X}}$ without folding the data into vecores could be otained.
	Here it's clear that the reduced version of the $k^{th}$ sample, i.e.,$\overline{\mathcal{X}}(:,:,k)\in \mathbb{R}^{k_1\times k_2}$ could be reduced separately  in each mode without folding. This means that the structure of data is preserved in the reducing process.
	Base on the properties of the  HOSVD, it could b shown that by small number of $k_1^1, k_2^i$, the reduced data have good reconstruction error. 
	
	In the following  in spired by the structure of this reduction, we present a tensor based discrimination function.
	By HOSVD decomposition of
	$\mathcal{X}^{(i)}$ the projected data $\overline{\mathcal{X}}^{(i)}$ in equation \eqref{m1} becomes
	\begin{align}
	\bar{\mathcal{X}}^{(i)}= & \notag
	\left(
	\begin{bmatrix}
	I_{k_1^i} &  0
	\end{bmatrix},
	\begin{bmatrix}
	I_{k_2^i} &  0
	\end{bmatrix},
	W
	\right)\boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{S}^{(i)} \notag
	\\&=\left( 
	W
	\right)_{3} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{S}^{(i)}(1:k_1, 1:k_2, :) \notag &
	\end{align}
	So,  each sample of the $i^{th}$ class in the reduced space has the following form
	\begin{align*}
	\bar{{\mathcal{X}}}^{(i)}(:,:,k) &= \left(  
	W^{(i)}(k,:)
	\right)_{3} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{S}^{(i)}(1:k_1^i, 1:k_2^i, :)\\
	=& \sum_{k' = 1}^{S_i} W^{(i)}(k,k') \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{S}^{(i)}(1:k_1^i, 1:k_2^i, k').
	\end{align*}
	This means that each sample in the $i^{th}$ class could be represented as linear combination of the slices  of the tensor $\overline{\mathcal{S}}^{(i)}=\mathcal{S}^{(i)}(1:k_1^i, 1:k_2^i, :)$.
	So if a test data like $X\in \mathbb{R}^{T\times R}$, be in the $i^{th}$ class
	it's natural to expect that its
	projected version into principle region and times spaces, spanned by $U_{k_1^i},V_{k_2^i}$, i.e,
	\[
	Z^{(i)}= \left( U_{k_1^i}^{(i)\sf T}, V_{k_2^i}^{(i)\sf T} 
	\right)_{1,2}\boldsymbol{\cdot} X
	\]
	could be approximated well as a linear combination of the slices of the tensor $\overline{\mathcal{S}}^{(i)}$ as follows
	\begin{equation}
	\label{m2}
	Z^{(i)} \approx \sum_{k=1}^{S_i} \lambda_k^i \overline{\mathcal{S}}^{(i)}(:,:,k).
	\end{equation}
	Based on this viewpoint, each test data $X$ could be assigned to a class that its prjected version have the best approximation in the form??. 
	Due to importance of core tensor elements with small indices in reconstruction of the signal part of data in comparison with the last parts,
	the small number $k_3^i< S_i$  of slices $\overline{\mathcal{S}}^{(i)}(:,:,k)$ could be used  in  \eqref{m2}. 
	
	In this viewpoint each test data
	$X$ assignment to the $l^{th}$class, if
	\[
	r_{l}=\min_{i=1,2} {r_{i}},
	\]
	where
	\begin{equation}
	\label{ls}
	r_{i}=\min_{{\lambda^{i}}} \|Z^{(i)} -\sum_{k=1}^{k_3^i} \lambda_k^i \overline{\mathcal{S}}^{(i)}(:,:,k)\|,\quad
	\lambda^i=\begin{pmatrix}
	\lambda_1^i\\
	\vdots\\
	\lambda_{s_i}
	\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}
	shows the  reconstruction error of the projected version of $X$ in the $i^{th}$ class.
	The minimization  \eqref{ls} is a simple least square problem that could be solved easily.
	The proposed method have an interesting property that  bring us to propose a novel method to improve its 
	quality.
	By the properties of HOSVD, the principle properties of the $i^{th}$ class could be reflected in the  slices of
	$\overline{\mathcal{S}}^{(i)}$. Also, for small indices these Slices have a  better   role in construction of main properties of this class. So the first slices of $\overline{\mathcal{S}}$
	could represent signal parts, while last ones do not this role and sometimes represents the wast parts.
	Now consider the test data $X$ added to data set $\mathcal{X}^{(i)}$ of the $i^{th}$ class. So new data set will be
	$\mathcal{\widetilde{X}}\in \mathbb{R}^{T\times R \times (S_{i}+1)}$. For example
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}^{(i)}(:,:,1:S_i)&=&{\mathcal{X}}^{(i)},\\
		\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}^{(i)}(:,:,S_i+1)&=&X.
	\end{eqnarray*}
	
	If $X$ belongs to this class then in HOSVD of this tensor $X$ reinforce the slices of core tensor with small indices. But when it  dose not belong to this class  it  will changes the behavior of last slices of core tensor of new tensor. This meas that before classification of a test data $X$, We could added it to both classes. This addition,  will changed the first slices of core tensor when it belongs to this  class or
	will changed the last Slices  when dose not belong. But in our classification method only the first Slices of core tensor are exits. Also the elements of $S$ in the first and second modes are filtered and we work with $S(1:k_1^i,1:k_2^i,1:k_3^i)$.  This means that by addition of $X$ in both classes for class that it belongs to it, the first slices in \eqref{ls}, will be  adapted to have good reconstruction for this data. But for a class that dose not belong to, this addition have small changes in the slices in \eqref{ls}.
	It should be mentioned that
	since $X$ added to both data sets, so we did not use its label and the method in true. After computing the HOSDVD of this new data sets $\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}^{(i)}$, we apply the method in \eqref{ls} for classification.  Algorithm 1 summarized the proposed classification method.

	In this section by HOSVD decomposition on both normal and eMCI data, we proposed a novel tensor based classification. The benifits of the proposed tensor based classification method could be summarized as follow
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This method  uses multi linear property of region-Time matrix data and  could works with time and region features separately based on their specific bases(corresponding singular matrices). This means that the classification works on data without folding them into vectors.
		\item  In this classification,  the test data has a role in construction of bases for both classes, without using its label. This  increase the quality of the discrimination. This could not applied on important classification methods like SVM, logistic regression classifier and neuronal networks. 
		\item This method works with time-region features, and dose not need to have FC matrices for each sample. So
		its computational complexity is more less than other state of the art methods  based on FC features. Also in this method we do not wary about the quality of FC methods.	
		It should be mentioned that our method also could be applied on FC matrices as input features. But in experiments the proposed method gives better results on original time-region features.  
	\end{itemize}
	In the experiments we compare the quality of the method with some of the sate of the art methods for recognition of eMCI like mentioned k-SICE and HON .
	Experimental results confirm the quality of the proposed method. In the next section we show that based the obtained HOSVD decomposition for both classes one could obtain appropriate General patters for normal and eMCI data.	
	\subsection{General Functional Connectivity for Normal and eMCI by tensor framework} \label{FC_Construction}
	
	
	As it was mentioned before, one of the main studies associated with rs-fMRI analysis is finding common functional disorders cause by a disease like AD. This can be done via constructing proper FC matrices. The majority of techniques calculate the FC matrix for each individual subject(like SICE). This may overlook tiny but common connectivities shared within a class. It is also noteworthy that the majority of non-stationary methods are not capable of constructing a relatable FC since the concept of a physical ROI is not well defined in them.    
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
%	Functional connectivity simply means the relation between different ROIs. As it was mentioned the FC could be used for two different purposes. In one approach for each sample its per sample FC matrix is obtained by its time-region matrix  and this new matrix is used in classification instead of time-region matrix. The obtained FC matrices in mentioned k-SICE and HON bloges to this type of application of FC.  ???ref 
%	
%	In other approach the general pattern of normal and abnormal data is desired. So in this approach based on all data only one FC for normal and one FC for abnormal data are obtained.
%	These general FC matrices could helps the experts persons to found the effects of desis in the??
%	{\color{blue}
%		Although several approaches have been proposed in order to find the functional connectivity, the majority of them focus on the individual samples rather that the whole class. This may overlook tiny but common connectivities shared within a class like the class of people in their early Alzheimer's disease.  
%		\textcolor{red}{ref?}
%	}
%v

	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	In this section we show that based on HOSVD decomposition one could  obtain  one representative functional connectivity for each normal or eMCI classes without obtaining the per-sample FC of all data separately. Here the classification is not our goal, instead  finding a general and representative
	relation of regions for eMCI and normal person is our demand. This general pattern could be used clinically by expert cognitive scientists to found  
	functional relation disorders caused by Alzheimer's disease.
	
	As we know in HOSVD  the singular matrices $U,V,W$, are the base of time, region features and also the samples, receptively. In the laset section by property of these matrices we designed our classification method.  know in this section we show that
	, the same idea could helps us to define a general FC matrix based on HOSVD decomposition for normal and
	eMCI data. It should be mentioned that here we did not use the FC of per-samples to construct this general FC matrix.
	
	In tensor  $\mathcal{X}^{(i)}$ of the $l^{th}$ class, the slice $\mathcal{X}^{(i)}(:,l,:)$ denotes
	the  behavior of $l^{th}$  region of all samples in all times in the $i^{th}$ class. So this could be consider as a feature of the $l^{th}$ region  of the $i^{th}$ class and each region is shown with an Times-sample feature matrix. Viewing each region as a slice would allow us to consider it's behavior in all time points and across all samples, which itself allows us to shed more light on common properties and ignore individual differences that is highly possible due to the presence of noise and outliers.
	So, by the properties of singular matrices in modes-1,3, for appropriate values
	$k_1^i,k_3^i$, each region $\mathcal{X}(:,l,:)$ could be reduced in both time and sample features, separately
	based on mode-1 and mode-3 truncated singular matrices $U_{k_1^i}^{(i)}$ and $W_{k_3}^{(i)}$
	as follows
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\mathcal{Y}^{(i)}(:,l,:) = \left( 
	{U_{k_1^i}^{(i)}}^{\trans},  {W_{k_3}^{(i)}}^{\trans} 
	\right)_{1,3} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{X}^{(i)}(:,l,:).
	\end{eqnarray}
	Here $\mathcal{Y}^{(i)}(:,l,:)$  denotes a reduced version of $\mathcal{X}^{(i)}(:,l,:)$ into space
	spanned by $U_{k_1^i}^{(i)}$ and $W_{k_3}^{(i)}$ in modes-1,3. So,
	\begin{align}
	\mathbb{R}^{k_1^i \times R \times k_3^i} \ni  {{\mathcal{Y}^{(i)}}} = \left( 
	{U_{k_1^i}^{(i)}}^{\trans}, {W_{k^i_3}^{(i)}}^{\trans} 
	\right)_{1,3}\boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{X}^{(i)} \label{DR_Version_FC1}
	\end{align} 
	denote all reduced regions of the $i^{th}$ class. By this structure  and substituting the HOSVD decomposition of $\mathcal{X}^{(i)}$ in \eqref{DR_Version_FC1},  we obtain
	\begin{align}
	{\mathcal{Y}}^{(i)}= & \notag
	\left(
	\begin{bmatrix}
	I_{k_1^i} &  0
	\end{bmatrix},
	V,
	\begin{bmatrix}
	I_{k_3^i} &  0
	\end{bmatrix}
	\right)\boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{S}^{(i)} \notag
	\\&=\left( 
	V
	\right)_{2} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{S}^{(i)}(1:k_1^i,:, 1:k_3^i) \notag &
	\end{align}
	
	and so
	
	\begin{align}
	\label{ok}
	{\mathcal{Y}}^{(i)}(:,k,:) &= \sum_{k'}^{R} V^{(i)}(k,k')\bar{\mathcal{C}}^{(i)}(:,k',:) \notag
	\\&= \left( V^{(i)}(k,:)\right)_2 \boldsymbol{\cdot} {\mathcal{C}}^{(i)}
	\end{align}
	in which 
	\[
	\mathbb{R}^{k_1^i\times R \times k_3^i}\ni {\mathcal{C}}^{(i)} = \mathcal{S}(1:k_1^i,:,1:k_3^i).
	\]
	% Although we do not use the FCs in the classification process, FC networks would allow further investigations on the brain activities. Let $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times R \times S}$, finding the FC for this class means finding the relation between mode-2 slices of $\mathcal{X}$. Viewing each region as a slice would allow us to consider it's behavior in all time points and across all samples, which itself allows us to shed more light on common properties and ignore individual differences that is highly possible due to the presence of noise and outliers. 
	
	%In order to calculate the FC, we first reduced the dimensions of our data similar to what we did in the previous part: 
	%\begin{align}
	%	\mathbb{R}^{k_1^i \times R \times k_3^i} \ni  \bar{{\mathcal{X}}} = \left( 
	%{U_{k_1^i}^{(i)}}^{\trans}, {U_{k^i_3}^{(i)}}^{\trans} 
	%	\right)_{1,3}\boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathcal{X} \label{DR_Version_FC}
	%	\end{align}
	%	it can be seen that each region slice can be written as:
	%	\begin{align}
	%	\label{ok}
	%	\bar{\mathcal{X}}^{(i)}(:,k,:) &= \sum_{k'}^{N_i} U_2^{(i)}(k,k')\bar{\mathcal{C}}^{(i)}(:,k',:) \notag
	%	\\&= \left( U_{2}^{(i)}(k,:)\right)_2 \boldsymbol{\cdot} \bar{\mathcal{C}}^{(i)}
	%	\end{align}
	%	in which 
	%	\[
	%	\bar{\mathcal{C}}^{(i)} = \mathcal{C}(1:k_1^i,:,1:k_3^i).
	%	\]
	The equation \eqref{ok}, show that the reduced version of each region in the $i^{th}$ class could be
	written as the linear combinations of  mode-2 slices of $\mathcal{C}^{(i)}$. So the coefficients of slices in this linear combination could be considered as a new feature for the $l^{the}$ region of the $i^{th}$ class. Also as we mentioned the first slices are better than the last ones to reflect the principle properties of the data. So for appropriate $k_3^i$ we could select only the fits coefficient in \eqref{ok} as  new features for the $l^{th}$ region. Mathematically this means each region  in the $i^{th}$ class could be represented by new feature $V(l,1;k_3^i)\in \mathbb{R}^{k_3^i}$.   
	
	The main benefit of this approach is that each
	region could be represented only be a vector with size $k_3^i$, instead large feature matrix  time-sample. Now different methods could be used to find the correlation of reigns based on this new type of feature and clean matrix $V(:,1:k_{3}^i)$ which its rows corresponding to different regions and columns are new features. Due to quality of  Sparse Inverse Covariance ,  this method is applied the obtained  feature-region matrix  $V(:,1:k_3^i)^{\sf T}$  in order to find the functional connectivity of the $i^{th}$ class.

	\section{EXPERIMENTAL STUDY}
	\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Experimental Settings}
	
	Rs-fMRI data of $196$ subjects were downloaded from the ADNI website\footnote{http://adni.loni.usc.edu}. Nine subjects were discarded
	due to the corruption of data, and the remaining $187$ subjects were preprocessed for analysis. After removing subjects that had problems in the preprocessing steps, such as large head motion,
	$156$ subjects were kept, including $26$ AD, $44$ early MCI, $38$ late MCI, $38$ NC, and ten significant memory concern labeled by ADNI. We used the $38$ NC and the $44$ early MCI because our focus in this paper is to identify MCI at very early stage, which is the most challenging and significant task in AD
	prediction. The IDs of the $82$ ($38$ NC and $44$ early MCI) subjects are provided in the supplementary material. 
	
	The data are acquired on a $3$-T (Philips) scanner with TR/TE set as $3000/30$
	ms and flip angle of $80◦$. Each series has $140$ volumes, and each volume consists of 48 slices of image matrices with dimensions
	$64 \times 64$
	with voxel size of
	$ 3.31 \times  3.31 \times 3.31$
	$mm^3$ . The preprocessing is carried out using SPM12 and DPARSFA [40]. The
	first ten volumes of each series are discarded for signal equilibrium. Slice timing, head motion correction, and MNI space normalization are performed. Participants with too much head motion are excluded. The normalized brain images are warped into automatic anatomical labeling (AAL) [41] atlas to obtain $116$ ROIs as nodes. By following common practice [15]–[17], the ROI mean time series are extracted by averaging the time series from all voxels within each ROI and then bandpass filtered to obtain multiple sub-bands as in [17].
	
	
	
	\subsection{Classification}
	
	Almost every subject in ADNI dataset has several scans. Usually a random scan data is selected and enters the processing step. This random selection may cause several problems \textcolor{red}{ref}. Since the number of train data is very low, a small perturbation in it could drastically change the set of input parameters in order to achieve the highest prediction accuracy and other classification evaluation methods. Also achieving high quality results with a classifier does not guarantee its effectiveness on other datasets even with fine tuning the parameters since the training set may contain outliers and unidentified corrupted data. 
	In order to show that the proposed framework is less sensitive against the choice of different perturbations and is less vulnerable towards the aforementioned issues, we have selected $18$ different perturbations and two test state of the art classification methods on them: \textbf{HON} and \textbf{k-SICE}.   
	To make full use of the limited subjects, a leave-one-out procedure is used for training and test. That is, each sample is reserved for test in turn, while the remaining samples are used for training.
	We have use five
	evaluation measures: accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), Youden’s index(YI), F-score, and balanced accuracy (BAC).
	\textcolor{red}{Tan Book} 
	
	%The detailed definitions
	%of these seven statistical measures are provided in Table \eqref{Table_1}, where TP, TN, FP, and FN denote the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative, respectively, and 
	%$precision =  \frac{TP}{TP + FP}  $ 
	%and 
	%$recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$.
	In this article, we treat the eMCI samples as positive class and the NC samples as negative class.

	\subsubsection{Classification performance}
	The classification accuracy measure(ACC), After fine-tuning the input parameter set for each method, shows that for $16$ out of $18$ different perturbations, our approach works better than k-SICE, the same also holds for $15$ datasets comparing to HON. i.e. in $88.8 \%$ of datasets, proposed method works better than k-SICE and in $83.3 \%$ of datasets, it works better that FON.  
	The highest classification accuracy($86.59\%$) is achieved with the proposed method in the $15$th perturbation. The highest accuracy for the HON ($84.15\%$) is achieved in the $14$th, and the highest accuracy for the SICE method ($85.37\%$) is achieved in the $6$th perturbation. As it was mentioned before, being stable when the input dataset changes is a very important aspect for a classifier, in order to measure the stability, standard deviation of accuracy along with other measures are
	calculated. The std. of accuracy for proposed method is $0.64$ times less than HON and $1.73$ times less than SICE method. Similar results also holds for other classification measures.

		}
		\label{g3.2}
	\end{figure*}
	
	
	Figure \eqref{g3.2} shows the performance of these three methods in all five measurements. Some statistical information about these plots are also included in the embedded table. As it can bee seen in this figure, similar to the accuracy, the proposed method in overall works much better than FON and k-SICE. For a better Demonstration, table \eqref{AVG} provides the average of several classification measurements scores for all permutations. 
	\begin{table}
		\begin{center}
			\caption{The Average of Different Classification Measurements in all perturbations in \% }

		\end{center}
	\end{table}
	As it can be seen in this table, the average accuracy of Proposed method which is $80.43 \%$ is $4.77\%$ higher than the next method HON, and $4.86 \%$ better than k-SICE. It is noteworthy that The other two methods i.e HON and SICE shows similar results in average.

	\subsubsection{Runtime Comparison}
	One other key features of proposed method is that it works significantly faster that the other two methods. Table \eqref{Time} shows the average elapsed time (Training plus Testing) of each method for all selected permutations. These methods were executed in matlab R2017b and carried with an intel Core-i7 processor and $16$GB of RAM. As it can be seen in this table, proposed method is more that $600$ times faster than HON and $20$ times faster that SICE.   
	\begin{table}

			\caption{Elapsed time of the test and train phase in seconds}

			\end{tabular}
			%}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}
	Having a huge execution time specially affects the parameter selection for HON, since it uses cross-validation procedure in order to find the optimal parameters which itself require several  runs of the algorithm. 
	
	%\subsubsection{Parameter Estimation and Sensitivity}
	%As it was discussed before, the choice of parameters drastically affect the performance of the aforementioned classifier. 
	
	
	
	\subsection{Functional connectivity Network}
	The functional connectivity networks of the Normal and eMCI classes was obtained via proposed method as it is described in \eqref{FC_Construction}.
	In order to better highlight the differences between Normal and eMCI subjects, a difference graph $D$ is constructed by subtracting the Normal FC from the eMCI FC. This graph could be seen in Figure\eqref{g3.3}. 
	The nodes of $D$ shows the ROIs according to the AAL atlas. The size of each node is proportional to its graph clustering coefficient, i.e. the bigger node, demonstrates higher activity in eMCI subjects in the corresponding ROI. 
	Similar to nodes, the size of each edge is also proportional to the correlation between two ROI's. In addition, the edges are also color coded in a way that the green edges shows the positive edges in $D$ and the orange edges shows the negative edges in $D$. In this manner, the green edges demonstrates decreasing in activity between the corresponding nodes in eMCI subjects and vice versa, the orange edges shows increasing activity between corresponding ROIs in the eMCI subjects.   
	
	As it can be seen in the difference graph, the big nodes i.e. ROIs with higher activities does not necessarily establish strong connections with the other nodes. As an obvious example, higher activities in Lingual gyrus(ROI index: 47,48)\cite{r24,r25}, Calcarine sulcus(ROI index: 43, 44)\cite{r26,r27}, Supplementary motor area(ROI index: 19,20)\cite{r27,r28} and Temporal\_mid\_L(ROI index: 85)\cite{r29} are easily detectable. The majority of ROIs located in frontal lobe also shows rather high activities comparing to normal subjects\cite{r30,r31}.
	
	Similar to the nodes, strong edge between two ROIs does not necessarily requires the nodes to be highly active in eMCI. Although a strong edge does indicate high activities and functional connectivity between the two corresponding ROIs. The difference Graph shows significant increase in connectivity between 
	Rectus(ROI index: 28, 27 in Frontal lobe) and 
	Parietal\_Sup\_R(ROI index: 60 in Parietal lobe) \cite{r40, r41},
	Frontal\_Inf\_Orb\_R(ROI index: 16 in Frontal lobe) and
	Cingulum\_Ant(ROI index: 31,32 in Limbic lobe)\cite{r42},
	Insula\_L, Temporal\_Pole\_Sup\_L(ROI index: 29,83 in Limbic lobe) and
	Pallidum\_R, Caudate\_R(ROI index: 29,83 in Sub Cortical Grey Nuclei)\cite{r43}. It can also be seen that within activities in frontal lobe also increased in patients with eMCI\cite{r44}. There is a decrease in connectivity between Amygdala\_L(ROI index: 41 in Sub Cortical Grey Nuclei) with Frontal\_Mid\_Orb\_R(ROI index: 10 in Sub Frontal lobe) and ParaHippocampal\_L(ROI index: 39 in Sub Limbic lobe)\cite{r45}. The connectivity between Heschl\_L(ROI index: 79 in Temporal lobe) and two ROIs Temporal\_Mid\_R(ROI index: 86 also in Temporal lobe) and Occipital\_Inf\_R(ROI index: 54 in Occipital lobe) also decreased in eMCI\cite{r46}.  
	
	\subsubsection*{\textbf{Regarding the Cerebellum and Vermis}}
	In fMRI data analysis and especially in Alzheimer's disease studies, ROIs within the Cerebellum and Vermis are usually excluded since their role was regarded as insignificant\cite{r47, r48}. Recent studies have shown that the traditional assumption that Cerebral area is essential only for the coordination of voluntary motor activity and motor learning is not valid and indicates the significant role of cerebellum in nervous system function, cognition and emotion\cite{r32}. 
	
	As it can be seen in the difference graph that we obtained, ROIs within Cerebellum and Vermis are highly active and both their intra and inter connections are noticeable. There is an increasing functional connectivity between the Limbic lobe especially 
	Hippocampus\_R, Temporal\_Pole\_Mid(ROI index: 38,87,88)
	and Cerebral areas in eMCI patients. Also, the connectivity between Occipital lobe, especially Occipital\_mid\_R(ROI index: 52), the Frontal lobe, especially in Frontal\_mid\_orb(ROI index: 9,10) and Cerebral areas seems to decrease in patients with eMCI.

	\section{Conclusion}
	The majority of classification techniques uses the vectorized version of data as the input of the discriminant function. As the number of the dimensions grows, i.e. when data is naturally a high order tensor, this vectorization become problematic and it would highly affect the  performance. Taking advantage of the techniques designed for the tensors, we have developed a framework for fMRI data analysis in which the following objectives: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 
		Classification 
		\item 
		General Functional Connectivity network
	\end{enumerate}
	are achieved via a singe \textbf{H}igh \textbf{O}rder \textbf{SVD} of the input tensors. 
	
	Extensive studies on the rs-fMRI provided by ADNI shows the superiority of the proposed framework in both classification and functional connectivity. The obtained FC network not only acknowledge the previous discovered connections but also reveals new connectivity patterns previously unknown.
	The framework proposed in this paper can be easily extended to other studies involved with high order data.
